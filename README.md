### Key Insights
-  TVS King Zs+Fi-BsVI 4sCNG 30Ltr contributed 82% of total revenueâ€”requiring priority stock management
-  Overstocking due to misaligned purchase-surplus (e.g., June, August) increased operational costs; balanced demand in October showcased improvement
-  ABC and turnover analyses highlighted models with poor performance, indicating need for discounting and marketing focus
-  Recommended maintaining a buffer stock of top sellers, implementing targeted offers for slow movers, using predictive analytics for demand, and expanding digital presence

### Recommendations
-  Reduce slow-moving inventory via discounts and bundles
-  Optimize fast-seller stock with buffer policies
-  Enhance demand forecasting using analytics and historical data
-  Improve supply chain logistics for faster restocking
-  Strengthen digital marketing and online engagement
